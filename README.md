# Introduction
The Philosopher project is an implementation of the classic "Dining Philosophers" problem, a fundamental concept in concurrent programming and computer science. The problem illustrates synchronization issues that arise when multiple processes or threads share resources. In this project, five philosophers sit around a table with five forks, and each philosopher needs two forks to eat. The challenge lies in preventing deadlocks and ensuring that each philosopher can eat without causing a resource conflict.

The project requires a deep understanding of threads, mutexes, and semaphores, as well as the ability to manage concurrent processes effectively. By working on Philosopher, students develop critical skills in solving synchronization problems and implementing efficient resource management strategies in a multi-threaded environment.

# The difficulties

Once we grasp the concepts of multi-threading and concurrency, it might seem straightforward to use a monitoring thread to control the program flow. However, introducing an additional thread that continuously monitors can lead to inefficiencies, as it creates a blocking thread that consumes resources unnecessarily. In programs that rely on real-time timers for time calculations, this approach can introduce errors under extreme conditions.

To eliminate the need for a monitoring thread, I introduced a special mapping array that tracks the "dead time" of each philosopher. I refer to it as a "mapping" array because the first element always corresponds to the philosopher closest to dying. Whenever a philosopher eats, they move themselves to the end of this array. As a result, all threads only need to check the first element of this array to determine if the program should be stopped. This approach simplifies the process and avoids the inefficiencies of a monitoring thread.
